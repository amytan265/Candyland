# Key  
This is a key of the special cards.  

If you draw a card with a star, perform the action associated with it.

* Red Star: Skip your next turn. 
* White Star: Draw another card during your current turn.  
* Gold Star: Switch the position of your gingerbread with the person who is drawing the next card. 
* Black Star: Go back to the first square on the board.

If you draw a card with a candy, you must move your piece to the corresponding square on the board. 

* Lollipop
