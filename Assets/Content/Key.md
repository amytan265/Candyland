This is a key of the special cards.  

If you draw a card with a candy, you have to perform the action associated with it.

* Lollipop: Skip your next turn. 
* Dango: You may draw another card during your current turn.  
* Peppermint: Switch the position of your gingerbread with the person who is drawing the next card. 
* Jelly bean: Go back to the first square on the board.
