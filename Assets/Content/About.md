# About

For our final group project in *Computational Problem-Solving in the information Domain II* (ISTE-121), our group created a digital version of the popular kid's board game Candyland to which we added a small twist. This program was written in java and assets were made entirely by the group members. To maximize interactiveness, we decided to let the users themselves have control over their pieces, and added a chat functionality on the side so that players can communicate with their opponents. For your convenience, the rules/directions for this game were added to the Menu bar along with this about page, and there is a key/guide in the interface underneath the 'Draw' button that tells you what our special cards mean. 

We hope you enjoy!
