<h1>About</h1>
<p>
<strong><em>This program is dedicated to John Duckett.</em></strong> For our final group project in <i>Computational Problem-Solving in the information Domain II</i> (ISTE-121), our group created a digital version of the popular kid's board game Candyland to which we added a small twist.
This program was written in java and assets were made entirely by the group members except for royalty free icons that we downloaded from fa-con.
To maximize interactiveness, we decided to let the users themselves have control over their pieces, and added a chat functionality on the side so that players can communicate with their opponents.
For your convenience, the rules/directions for this game were added to the Menu bar along with this about page, and there is a key in the menu as well that tells you what our special cards mean.</p>
<br /><p>We hope you enjoy!</p><hr /><br /> <strong>Regina Bass</strong>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; Web and Mobile Computing <br /> <strong>Amy Tan</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -  &nbsp; Web and Mobile Computing <br /> <strong>Miki Mian</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   -  &nbsp; Human Centered Computing</html>
